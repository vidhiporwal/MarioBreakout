        of prize blocks by deflecting the mario from the brick. The brick may move
        horizontally and is controlled with the help of Arrow Keys.
        The player gets 3 lives to start with; a life is lost if mario hits
        the bottom of the screen. When all the prize blocks have been collected , the
        player advances to a new, harder level. There are 3 levels. As the level
        advances,the quantity of prize blocks increase. If all lives are lost, the game
        is over. There are special prize blocks, which give a boost in power if
        collected or may lower the speed of the brick.
